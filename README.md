# Spotify roaster

This project's idea is fully taken from [Github Roast](https://github.com/codenoid/github-roast). 
I thought it would be funny for some llm to also roast Spotify accounts, so I used it as a Django learning opportunity.

Work in progress

It works only on the backend side as I have no current interest of coding frontend/templates for now. Might change in the future.
